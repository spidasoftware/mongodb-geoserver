# mongodb-geoserver
A [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) plugin for [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/).

Download [Geoserver 2.19.0](http://geoserver.org/release/2.19.0/) (Platform Independent Binary)

### To setup a dev environment:
1. Download deployment zip from [here](https://dev.spidasoftware.com/artifactory/exposed-repo/com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/)
2. Unzip the deployment
3. Move the groovy jar, the mongo java driver jar and the mongodb-geoserver jar into  geoserver/WEB-INF/lib
4. Restart geoserver.

### Add a store and layers for development
1. Create a mapping file that includes a mapping for each mongo collection that will be published.
2. In geoserver, click "Workspaces", then click "Add new workspace"
3. Set the name to "DB" and the Namespace URI to "http://spida/db" and check Default Workspace
4. In geoserver, click "Stores", then click "Add new Store", then click "Mongo DB"
5. Select the DB workspace, name it SPIDADB, set MongoDB connection parameters, and the path to the mapping file.
6. If automatically brought to the layers page to publish layers, skip the next step
7. In geoserver, click "Layers", then click "Add new resource", then select "DB:SPIDADB"
8. Publish each layer.  Set Declared SRS to "EPSG:4326" and bounding box values all to 1

You can see all types and properties [at this geoserver url](http://localhost:8080/geoserver/DB/wfs?service=wfs&version=1.1.0&request=DescribeFeatureType).  And here is a [WFS Reference](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/services/wfs/reference.html).

NOTE: When min builds this is all done automatically by copying files from [min/scripts/docker/tomcat/geoserver](https://github.com/spidasoftware/min/tree/master/scripts/docker/tomcat/geoserver)

### Point projectmanager at geoserver

1. [Uncomment url](https://github.com/spidasoftware/min/blob/master/projectmanager/deployments/dev/projectmanagerConfig.groovy#L77) 
so that asset service bean gets created.
2. Start projectmanager
3. Edit a permission group and add the spida db asset service.

### Mapping file
The mapping file will map a feature collection to a mongo collection.  If there is multiple objects nested in a collection each nested object can be published as a feature.  Here is an example [mapping.json](src/test/resources/mapping.json) file.  There is also a [location.json](src/test/resources/location.json) and [design.json](src/test/resources/design.json) that the mapping file and tests use.

Top level fields in the mapping.json file:
* typeName: (Required) The typeName for the feature that geoserver will use
* collection: (Required) The MongoDB collection that the feature is located in.
* idAsAttribute: (Required) Whether or not to include the id of the object as an attribute for the features.
* geometry: (Not Required) The geometry for the collection, must include the name, crs and path.
* displayGeometry: (Not Required) Whether or not to add the geometry to the feature.
* attributes: (Not Required) Must add the name for the attribute and the path to the value,  can also add a class([Double](https://github.com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/blob/mongodb-geoserver-plugin/src/test/resources/mapping.json#L692), [Long](https://github.com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/blob/mongodb-geoserver-plugin/src/test/resources/mapping.json#L32) or [Boolean](https://github.com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/blob/mongodb-geoserver-plugin/src/test/resources/mapping.json#L311))
* subCollections: (Not Required)
     + subCollectionPath: (Required) path to the subcollection.
     + includeInDefaultQuery: (Required) If true the query for objects will include a criteria that the length of the array is greater than 0.
     + attributes: (Not Required) Similar to attributes for top level objects but more options instead of just the path value.
         - path: The path from the top level object, the main collection object.
         - subCollectionPath: The path from the subCollection for the value.
         - concatenate: Will concatenate these values together with an underscore [example](https://github.com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/blob/mongodb-geoserver-plugin/src/test/resources/mapping.json#L128)
         - useKey: Use the key of the object for the value of the attribute [example](https://github.com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/blob/mongodb-geoserver-plugin/src/test/resources/mapping.json#L128(.
         - useValue: Use the value of the object for the value of the attribute [example](https://github.com/spidasoftware/mongodb-geoserver/blob/mongodb-geoserver-plugin/src/test/resources/mapping.json#L171).
